# TIDBIT-Extras

NOTE: These are extra community-supplied keymaps that weren't easily added to the QMK firmware repo when the TIDBIT was added, because of special features or otherwise.

The main TIDBIT firmware is in the [QMK repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/nullbitsco/tidbit). You'll need that first.

## How to use

Download and copy everything into this repo into your existing `qmk_firmware/keyboards/nullbitsco/tidbit` folder. Then `qmk compile -kb nullbitsco/tidbit -km all`. You can also clone this as a git submodule into the tidbit folder if you wish.
